# Large-Area-Optical-Frequency-Detectors-for-Single-Shot-Phase-Readout
"Large Area Optical Frequency Detectors\\ for Single-Shot Phase Readout" Manuscript - code to reproduce the presented data.
The raw data can be downloaded from https://syncandshare.desy.de/index.php/s/qGrMQxLQCj6MGHm . Please copy the two folder "4CMTO" (Main text data) and "4IMCT3" (SI data) into the directory of the code.

To produce the analysis presented in the main text, please open jupyter notebook Main.ipynb. For the SI SI.ipynb respectively.
Additionally, the estimation of the peak currents is found in notebook InstCurrentEstimation.ipynb. 
The modelling of a single nanoantenna is found in AntennaModelling.ipynb.
